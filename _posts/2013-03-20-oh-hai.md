After an incredibly long time of having no website, or at least a website that was a placeholder for something planned but never appeared, I've finally gotten my act together to put something up.

The layout was kindly put together by my colleague [Ed Boaden](http://edboaden.com). I don't really have the design chops to put something together myself but I am learning, so maybe this will change at some point in the future!

### What am I looking to do with this website?

The plan for this website is for me to have a place to highlight some of the work I do as well as ramble on about things in general. People I work with know that I love to ramble on for hours about things I find interesting, even if they don't. This is probably a far better place for me to dump those ideas!

### What kind of magic runs this website?

This site has been put together using the wonderful [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) static-site generator. It is running on [Heroku](https://heroku.com) because that is a great platform for me to get something up and running without worrying about complicated configuration or managing my own hosting.

Posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which is a nice tool to convert text into HTML.

Eventually (if I can figure out how to), I'm going to convert the stylesheets I'm using in to [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) because it is a really nice way to generate CSS with some great extensions on top of vanilla CSS.
